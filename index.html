<h1>Welcome to my Blog!</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Isabella! I love traveling, exploring new cities, and discovering the best spots for food, coffee, and art. This site is a collection of my favorite places—hidden gems, must-visit museums, and can’t-miss restaurants from the cities I’ve explored.

Whether you're planning a trip or just looking for inspiration, I hope my recommendations help you experience a city the way I do: through its flavors, culture, and creativity.

Happy exploring!</p>
